    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I, Praveenn Loganathan, age 20, is a student at Northampton University having
      nearly completed year 1 Computing (Software Engineering). Prior to this course, I
      completed my GCSE studies in St Marys RC High School and following that I did
      BTEC diploma courses in ICT of both Level 2 and Level 3 in Croydon College. In
      addition to these primary educations I scored 6.5 in IELTS english exam as well. <br><br>
      Other than my studies, I have interest in watching videos or reading magazine or text
       book articls about new discoveries, inventions, discussions and others.
       Due to my interest in these technological concepts, I always had interests in subjects involving
       problem solving, creativity, logics, patterns and designs. It ca be said that this is on of
       the reasons for me to select a path towards computing. However, althogh I enjoyed
        these followings, what I really interested about are visiting exotic and amazing places
        in the world and this is the reason for me to develop this specific website</p>
    <h2>About My Collection</h2>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, my real reason to develop this collection is because of my
      second interest, which is in exotic places around the world. These places are
      picked from different newspapers, internet and magazines. Some of my photos
      may not seems to be real but all of them are. It is the main reason to put these
      pictures; because many of us call these places as graphics while I found and
      Learned about them myself. They are</p>
      <h3>Hehuanshan Mountain, Taiwan</h3>
      <p>Hehuanshan is the 11,207 ft mountain in Central Taiwan. The central peak of this
        mountain lies on the boundaries of Nantou and Hualien counties which is also
        where the Taroko Gorge National Park is in. Hehuanshan is famous for the local
        people of central Taiwan. The 3,421-metre East Peak and 3,422-metre North Peak
        of Hehuanshan are actually both higher than the main peak <br>
        The beauty of this place is when its is visited in the night time. As displayed in the
        picture this mountain is a beautiful place which can be visited and is not a
        graphical image</p>
      <h3>Cornwall, England</h3>
      <p>Cornwall is an English Town located at the very bottom of the Southwest of
        England. To be precise it is  bordered to the north and west by the Celtic Sea, while
        the east by the county of Devon and the south of this town is by the English
        Channel. <br>
        The main reason for me to have an interest towards this place is because I can visit
        it anytime I wanted and secondly when I first saw it in a picture, it reminded me
        the Berk village from the How to Train Your Dragon Franchise.</p>
      <h3>Horseshoe Bend, Arizona</h3>
      <p>Horseshoe Bend is a horseshoe-shaped entrenched river of the Colorado River
         located near the town of Page, Arizona, United States. It is located 5 miles
         downstream from the Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell within Glen Canyon
         National Recreation Area, about 4 miles southwest of Page. <br>
         Although I did not initially liked it, its unique structure and the arcing appearence
         of the river is rather unique to look</p>
      <h3>Kowloon Bay, Hoong Kong</h3>
      <p>A bay and a town in Hong Kong, formerly known as Ngau Tau Kok Industrial
        Area, located at the east of the Kowloon Peninsula and north of Hong Kong
        Island. It is the eastern portion of Victoria Harbour, between Hung Hom and Lei
        Yue Mun. The bay was divided into half when the runway of the former Kai Tak
        International Airport was constructed in the middle of the bay. <br>
        The reason for me to visit to such place is because, like Hehuanshan, it is a
        beautiful scenary to look at.</p>
      <h3>Lovech, Bulgaria</h3>
      <p> a city in north-central Bulgaria. It is the administrative centre of the Lovech
        Province and of the subordinate Lovech Municipality. The city is located about
        93 miles northeast from the capital city of Sofia. Near Lovech are the towns of
        Pleven, Troyan and Teteven. <br>
        In the collection, Instead of calling it lovech, I called it lovech caves because of
        the beautiful cave path which also looks dangerous and thrilling to look at.</p>
      <h3>Seljalandsfoss Waterfall, Iceland</h3>
      <p>Seljalandsfoss is one of the best known waterfalls in Iceland. It is located in the
        South Region in Iceland right by Route 1 and the road that leads to Þórsmörk Road
        249. The waterfall is one of the most popular waterfalls and natural wonders in
        Iceland. The waterfall drops 60 m (197 ft) and is part of the Seljalands River that
        has its origin in the volcano glacier Eyjafjallajökull. One of the interesting things
        about this waterfall is that visitors can walk behind it into a small cave. <br>
        The first time I saw it was in a US tv series known as Amazing Race 6. During
        that time I never had interest on it. But when I found it as a wallpaper for my 
        computer about a year age, I decided to visit there myself</p>
      <h3>Rab Island, Croatia</h3>
      <p>Rab is a Croatian island in the Adriatic Sea. It’s known for the old town of the
        same name, encircled by ancient walls. The town’s 4 prominent church bell towers
        include the Romanesque tower at the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed
        Virgin Mary and the tower at the ruins of the Church of St. John the Evangelist.
        The monastery at the 16th-century Church of St. Justine is now a museum of
         sacral objects. <br>
         Even as a kid, visiting to the countries and islands of the Balkans region of Europe
         such as as Italy, Romania and Greece are my life long dream and this place
         reminds me of some video games I used to play as a kid. Other than that, I have a
         passion for the Balkan culture and mythology as well. It could be said that this
         may be the reason for me to go there</p>
      <h3>Villach City, Austria</h3>
      <p>Villach is a city on the Drava River in the Austrian province of Carinthia, near the
        Italian and Slovenian borders. It’s known as a gateway to nearby lakes Faak and
        Ossiach, as well as the Villach Alps. On the main square, St. Jakob’s Church
        steeple has sweeping views. Nearby in Schillerpark, the Relief von Kärnten is a
        giant 3D scale model of Carinthia. On the outskirts, Warmbad-Villach has modern
        thermal baths. <br>
        Austria, a perfect place to go for holiday for someone of my age. In comparison to
        the other to, this city is more elegant and near nature. But the main reason for me
        to go there is because I never visited a city based/next to a river.</p>
      <h3>Zakynthos Beach, Greece</h3>
      <p>Zakynthos is a Greek island in the Ionian Sea and a well-known summer resort.
        The harbor city of Zakynthos is the capital and major hub, centered around
        waterfront Solomos Square. Popular beaches like Agios Nikolaos, Alykanas and
        Tsilivi offer swimming and water sports. Accessed by boat, Navagio beach is the
        site of a famed 1980 shipwreck resting in a sandy cove framed by cliffs. <br>
        There is  nothing I can tell about this place. It defines how a summer vacation
        should be spent in Europe. The first time when I heard its name is in a tv series
        called Grimm. When I checked about it in the internet, I am amazed with the
        scenery. This island fulfils all of my holiday dreams</p>
