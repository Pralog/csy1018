The things that went well during the development are the static forms, image listing and  the overall development of this website. I managed to complete all the bassic requirements that are necessesary for the website along with the addition of a few pictures and the forms. Other than that I also managed to upload photos of 9 different locations and their details. While I listed each picture in I wrotee brief details about each of them and my opinion to visit each place in a seperate one.
On the other hand, I cannot develop it as a complete static website at all. Although there are minor errors and some major errors exist in my work, I was unable to create CSS File for each of the html files. In the end what I have really accomplished is nothing but a basic and static site that won't take much time to develop.
The total amount of time I required to complete this site is approximately 60 hours. I spent 6 hours per day, developing this website, took a total of 10 days to complete.
